**Diagram Descriptions:**

* There are no diagrams explicitly described in the provided text.  Some problems describe geometrical figures (triangles, parabolas, circles), but no diagram is given for them.  The solutions section that follows also may allude to diagrams that were in the original question papers but are missing. Some solutions suggest diagrams might be required, e.g: "Applying conservation of angular momentum about pulley" implies an implied diagram.


**Additional Notes:**

* The provided text is part of a larger document, possibly a question paper.  It contains problems, options (A, B, C, D, or matching sets), and brief problem descriptions.
*  Many questions are multiple choice or matching type, typical of standardized tests (such as JEE Advanced).
* The solutions portion (not included in the final extracted question list) likely contains the diagrams referenced in those specific problems.
