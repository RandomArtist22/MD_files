**Question 7:** For a hypothetical elementary reaction, 1/k  A  → 2B → 2C, where 1/k₁ = k₂. Initially only 2 moles of A are present. Total number of moles of A, B and C at the end of 75% reaction are X.  What will be the value of 2X?


**Question 8:** A vessel of 250 litres was filled with 0.01 mole of Sb₂S₃ and 0.01 mole of H₂ to attain the equilibrium at 440°C as (Sb₂S₃(s) + 3H₂(g) ⇌ 2Sb(s) + 2H₂S(g)). After equilibrium, the H₂S formed was analyzed by dissolving it in H₂O and treating with excess of Pb²⁺ to give 1.19g of PbS (M_Pb = 207) as precipitate. The value of Kc at 440°C is _____.
