**Questions and Diagram Descriptions:**

**Question 3:** When a resistance R is connected in series with an element A, the electric current is found to be lagging behind the voltage by V angle 30°. When the same resistance is connected in series with element B, current leads by 60°. When R, A, B are connected in series, the current new leads voltage by θ. Which is equal to tan⁻¹(K/√3), then the value of K is (assume same AC source is used in all cases).

**Question 4:** A ball of mass m = 2kg thrown from ground form point ‘O’ between two walls, W1 & W2 at a distance 5 cm from ‘O’ as shown in figure. Had the wall w2 not been there range of ball would have been 20 m. Horizontal component of velocity of ball at the time of projection was 5 m/s. All collisions are elastic. Average force acting on one of the walls (in newton) is. (Diagram needed to be analyzed.)

**Question 5:** A small object at P oscillates infront of a concave mirror as shown in the figure perpendicular to principal axis according to equation.  y = 4 sin(ωt + π/3) cm,  y is the displacement of particle perpendicular to principal axis. The amplitude (in cm) of image is. (Diagram needed to be analyzed.  Labels: C, R, P, 3R/2)

**Question 6:** A particle moves in a circle with a uniform speed, when it goes from a point A to a diametrically opposite point B, the momentum of the particle changes by  **P<sub>B</sub>-P<sub>A</sub> = -2kgm/s(j)**  and the centripetal force acting on it changes by  **F<sub>B</sub>-F<sub>A</sub> = -8N(i)** where **i, j** are unit vectors. Then the angular velocity (in rad/s) of the particle is. (Diagram of a circle with points A and B diametrically opposite.)

**Question 12:** The moles of He(g) present in the mixture sample is.

**Question 13:** The mole fraction of H2(g) present in the initial mixture is:

**Question 14:** Which of the following would be the structure of compound if test (a) is negative?

**Question 15:** Which of the following would not be the structure of compound (A) after test (b)?

**Question 16:** The structure assigned to compound (A) after the test (d) would be.

**Other questions:** The remaining questions are primarily multiple choice questions (MCQs) and matrix-matching questions, without diagram descriptions relevant to them.

**NOTE:**  Several of these problems require diagrams which are not included in this text extraction.  The question about the force on the walls, the mirror image problem, and the particle in a circle problem, along with others, absolutely need the visual for completion of the analysis.
