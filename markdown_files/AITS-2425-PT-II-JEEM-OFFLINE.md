## **Question Image 1**

#### Description:
The image shows a schematic diagram of an experiment to demonstrate the diffraction of light through a single-slit of varying widths. 

Key Elements:
- **Light Source**: A coherent light source such as a laser is emitting parallel beams of light.
- **Single-Slit**: Shown as a narrow horizontal line.
- **Screen**: Positioned at a distance from the slit where diffraction patterns can be observed.

**Annotations**:
- Label the light source as "Laser".
- Indicate different widths of the slit (e.g., 0.1 mm, 0.05 mm, 0.01 mm) using variable width lines.
- Mark the central bright fringe (maximum intensity) and point to secondary maxima and minima in the diffraction pattern.
- Indicate the direction of light propagation using arrows.

**Insights**:
The diffraction pattern for single-slit experiments displays alternating bright and dark fringes. The width of the slit inversely affects the width of the central bright fringe, with narrower slits producing wider diffraction patterns.

## **Solution Image 1**

#### Description:
The image contains both a mathematical expression and a graphical representation related to the diffraction phenomenon observed in the question image.

**Mathematical Expression**:
\[ I(\theta) = I_0 \left( \frac{\sin(\beta)}{\beta} \right)^2 \]
where:
- \( I(\theta) \) is the intensity of the diffracted light at an angle \(\theta\).
- \( I_0 \) is the maximum intensity at the central peak.
- \( \beta = \frac{\pi a \sin(\theta)}{\lambda} \)
- \( a \) is the width of the slit.
- \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of the incident light.
- \( \theta \) is the angular position on the screen.

**Graphical Representation**:
A plot showing the intensity \( I(\theta) \) as a function of the normalized angle \( \left( \frac{\beta}{\pi} \right) \).

**Annotations**:
- Highlight different regions in the mathematical formula corresponding to slit width \(a\), wavelength \(\lambda\), and intensity \(I(\theta)\).
- Label the x-axis of the graph as \( \frac{\beta}{\pi} \) and the y-axis as Normalized Intensity \( \left( \frac{I(\theta)}{I_0} \right) \).
- Mark the position of the central maximum.
- Show the positions of the first and second minima with annotations.

**Insights**:
This equation quantifies the intensity distribution in the diffraction pattern. The intensity distribution explains that the central maximum is the highest and that secondary maxima decrease rapidly in intensity. Minima occur at specific angles where the sine term in the numerator of the \(\left( \frac{\sin(\beta)}{\beta} \right)^2\) function equals zero.

## **Question Image 2**

#### Description:
This image presents a graphical question involving wave interference and shows two waves superimposing on a graph.

**Key Elements**:
- Two sine waves represented as \( y_1(x,t) = A \sin(kx - \omega t) \) and \( y_2(x,t) = A \sin(kx - \omega t + \phi) \).
- A resultant wave depicted by their superposition, shown as a third line.

**Annotations**:
- Label the x-axis as position \(x\) and the y-axis as displacement \(y\).
- Use different colors to distinguish the two source waves \( y_1 \) and \( y_2 \).
- Indicate the phase difference \(\phi\) and denote points of constructive (overlapping peaks) and destructive (peak-to-trough) interference.

**Insights**:
The resultant wave represents the superposition of two waves differing by a phase \(\phi\). Constructive interference occurs when peaks align and destructive interference occurs when a peak meets a trough. This principle underpins various applications in physics and engineering, particularly in sound and light interference patterns.

## **Solution Image 2**

#### Description:
This image explains the phase difference and intensity resulting from wave superposition using a mathematical derivation and graphical representation.

**Mathematical Expression**:
\[ y(x,t) = 2A \cos\left( \frac{\phi}{2} \right) \sin\left( kx - \omega t + \frac{ \phi}{2} \right) \]
where:
- \( y(x,t) \) is the resultant wave.
- \( A \) is the amplitude of the individual waves.
- \( \phi \) is the phase difference.
- \( k \) is the wave number.
- \( \omega \) is the angular frequency.

**Graphical Representation**:
A plot displaying the resultant wave \( y(x,t) \) against different phase angles \(\phi\), illustrating constructive and destructive interference regions.

**Annotations**:
- Label different curves with phase differences \(\phi = 0, \pi, 2\pi\).
- Indicate the amplitude factor \( 2A \cos\left( \frac{\phi}{2} \right) \) affecting the resultant wave.
- Show maximum intensity regions and minima on the graph.

**Insights**:
The amplitude of the resultant wave is modulated by the cosine term based on the phase difference \(\phi\). For \(\phi = 0\) (identical phase), the result is perfect constructive interference, while for \(\phi = \pi\) (opposite phase), destructive interference occurs. This relationship is fundamental in analyzing wave interference patterns.

## **Question Image 3**

#### Description:
The image provides a diagram related to a physics experiment, specifically an investigation on the interference of light waves from multiple slits.

**Key Elements**:
- A setup showing multiple slits equally spaced.
- Incident light source and screen for viewing the interference pattern.

**Annotations**:
- Mark the distance between the slits ( \( d \) ) and the width of each slit (\( a \)).
- Show the path difference between slits at different points on the screen.
- Indicate several positions of maxima and minima on the interference pattern.

**Insights**:
This setup demonstrates the principle of multiple-slit interference, where the detailed pattern results from adding phase contributions from each slit. The positions of bright (constructive interference) and dark (destructive interference) fringes depend on the slit separation and wavelength of light used, providing insights into the wave nature of light and wave equation applications.

## **Solution Image 3**

#### Description:
This image contains equations, graphical representations, and explanations regarding the intensity pattern from multiple slits.

**Mathematical Expression**:
\[ I(\theta) = I_0 \left( \frac{\sin\left( \frac{N \beta}{2} \right)}{\sin\left( \frac{\beta}{2} \right)} \right)^2 \left( \frac{\sin(\alpha)}{\alpha} \right)^2 \]
where:
- \( N \) is the number of slits.
- \( I(\theta) \) is the resultant intensity at angle \(\theta\).
- \( I_0 \) is the maximum intensity for a single slit.
- \( \beta = \frac{\pi d \sin(\theta)}{\lambda} \)
- \( \alpha = \frac{\pi a \sin(\theta)}{\lambda} \)
- \( d \) and \( a \) are the spacing between slits and width of a slit, respectively.
- \( \lambda \) is the wavelength.
- \( \theta \) is the angle of diffraction.

**Graphical Representation**:
A plot showing intensity \( I(\theta) \) against angle \(\theta\) highlighting primary and secondary maxima/minima.

**Annotations**:
- Label different intensity maxima and minima on the graph.
- Differentiate regions corresponding to overall multiple slit interference and single slit diffraction effects, using color-coding or markers.
- Highlight the expression for total intensity combining both slit separation and slit width effects.

**Insights**:
This equation and graphical representation illustrate that the intensity pattern from multiple slits comprises broader primary maxima with finer subsidiary maxima/minima between them. The detailed analysis includes recognizing the superposition of both diffraction and interference effects.
